## 🛠️ Development

### 📋 Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 12)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lvl-devs/cleanup-chaos.git
cd cleanup-chaos
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

5. Serve the built game:
```bash
npm run serve
```

6. Deploy to itch.io:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### 🚀 Deployment

The project is configured to deploy automatically to itch.io using Butler. 

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Deployment is restricted to project administrators only. Regular contributors cannot deploy the game.

#### For Administrators Only:

To set up deployment credentials:

1. Install Butler (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -L -o butler.zip https://broth.itch.ovh/butler/linux-amd64/LATEST/archive/default
unzip butler.zip && chmod +x butler && sudo mv butler /usr/local/bin/
```

2. Authenticate with itch.io:
```bash
butler login
```

3. Create your Butler configuration file:
```bash
cp .butler.toml.template .butler.toml
```

4. Edit `.butler.toml` with your actual values:
```toml
[defaults]
user = "your-itch-username"
game = "your-game-name"

[channels.html5]
path = "public"
description = "Web version (HTML5)"
```

**Configuration Notes:**
- Copy the template from `.butler.toml.template` to get started
- `user` MUST be the itch.io username that **owns** the game (not just the deployer)
- `game` must match exactly the game name from the itch.io URL
- If the game URL is `https://lvl-devs.itch.io/cleanup-chaos`, then:
  - `user = "lvl-devs"` (the game owner)
  - `game = "cleanup-chaos"` (the game identifier)
- The person deploying must have collaboration permissions on the itch.io game
- Butler credentials (from `butler login`) must have deployment access to this specific game

5. The deployment scripts will automatically read your credentials from `.butler.toml`

6. Deploy:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
